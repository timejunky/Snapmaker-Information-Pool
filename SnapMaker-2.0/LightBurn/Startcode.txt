; This line is spit out by Luban and Snapmaker settings in Lightburn, so this line is included.

; Section: User specific
; Individual machine settings as input is required
; ;;;;;;;;

; !!! Attention: Test yourself your Z value by own calibration!
; IMPORTANT, the Z value here is YOUR LASER HEIGHT on the touchscreen.
; Taking over the Z value without verification may lead to harm seriosly your rails, bed or laser module!!!
; Z Values are also depending on the way how your plate is mounted!

; !!! Attention: Keep the left rear corner free of any height obstacles 
;                in a reactangular area of 3cm x 7cm (to left edge x to rear edge)
;                Btw, this area depends on your own module and the manner of fixation (measure and assert yourself!)

; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
; !!!! Please confirm that you have read all comments carefully     !!!
; !!!! and assert to continue at own risc and responsibility        !!!
; !!!! Furthermore you agree and setup your own machine settings!   !!!
; !!!! Confirmation is done by commenting/ deactivating the line    !!!
; !!!! with M1999 below by a semicolon                              !!!
; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
; Sry, this will restart your machine as long as you do not admit AND READ ALL
M1999


; comment out corresponding your module and machine + after setting your z values

; 10W Laser - Example value only for orientation, use at own risc!!!
; close up fast and approxmiate slow
; 1. Z (always higher) to step down fast by F600 / 2. Z slowly aproximate by F600
;G0 Z35 F6000
;G0 Z23 F600

; 20W Laser - Example value only for orientation, use at own risc!!!
; close up fast and approxmiate slow
; 1. Z (always higher) to step down fast by F600 / 2. Z slowly aproximate by F600
;G0 Z45 F6000
;G0 Z31.1 F600

; 40W Laser - Example value only for orientation, use at own risc!!!
; close up fast and approxmiate slow
; 1. Z (always higher) to step down fast by F600 / 2. Z slowly aproximate by F600
;G0 Z85 F6000
;G0 Z58.3 F600
; fyi these values are valid for me with screws on 40W + quick snap on rail (see guide)

; General II

; Changes back to Work Coords
G54
; This sets Z Work Origin to 0, making your laser height as 0.
G92 Z0
; Moves the toolhead back up out of the way.
G0 Z300
; Back to machine coords!
G53

; IMPORTANT, this is the offset you found following my laser guide!
G0 X2 Y0 F6000
; this is my adjustment corresponds to my laser bed at left front corner
; G0 X-19 Y-14 F6000

; Oops, weâ€™re back in work coords.
G54
; Yep, we gotta set 0,0 on X,Y as well!
G92 X0 Y0
; This is a safety line, it brings the laser online at 0 power, basically a ready state.

; Light recommended to 30-50%

; Set flame detector sensitivity 
; fyi: what happens, if this triggers?
;      There is a short Warning on your display
;      but the maschine does not move away
;      This is the reason, why laser should never run UNATTENDED
;      LightBurn tries to continues after a while
;      You can change the sensitivity if the material test glows and triggers too fast
;
; M2002 T5 PXX The parameter carried after P, 
; if the value is in the range of 0-4095, 
; the larger the value, the more sensitive it is.
; To disable the flame detector, enter a value greater than 4095, such as 4096.
; Examples for the flame detector

; ATTENTION: High risc to burn down your appartment

; Flame sensor off 
; see guide... I won't write it here :-)
